1) Each study is clasified as either smoke_exposure or smoker_status. Smoke_exposure means that case cells were exposed to cigarette smoke or cigarette smoke extract, while control cells were exposed to something similar to regular air. Smoker_status means that case cells are taken from smokers, control cells are taken from non-smokers, and neither cases nor controls are exposed to cigarette smoke prior to RNA sequencing. 

2) For smoke_exposure studies, all cases and controls allowed to rest in between 2-8 hours following their respective exposures are included in the RNA-seq analysis. We believe that 24+ hours of rest following the exposure is too long because it allows some of the gene-expression to re-equilibriate, and less than 2 hours doesn't allow gene expression levels to transition. We therefore exclude all such samples from all analyses. 

3) The anatomical part from which cells are derived is also included in each study. We attempt to only include studies conducted on normal respiratory cells, so cells such as cancer cells and alveolar macrophages are excluded.  

4) HS573 will be ignored because it doesn't follow any of the paradigms outligned by 1 and 2

5) cases are in column A and controls are in column B, always

6) the screenshot in this folder shows all selected cases and controls for HS1165

7) for HS1200, there is no significantly different expression between symtomatic and asymptomatic smokers, so both are included as cases

8) no healthy_smoker vs nonsmoker hits in HS1269
